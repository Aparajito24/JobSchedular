      <p>
        We help hourly teams get shift done.
        Everything we do starts with a mission to help hourly teams work better together.
         We deliver on that mission by providing hourly workplaces with an integrated scheduling, time tracking, and team messaging solution that enhances the employee experience and drives better business outcomes. It’s a complete employee management solution that ensures reliable shift coverage, engaged employees, and faster decisions that help hourly teams work better together.
        <br><br>To go beyond means to exceed expectations not by 10x, but by 100x. 
        We strive to ensure every encounter with our people, products, and brand is memorable and helpful. We value artistry in our craft. Building software is both art and science. We believe a cohesive visual, lingual, and technical customer experience is what separates good software from great software. The best products, services, and people are dependable. Lead with empathy. Reduce friction in what you build, write, and communicate. Embrace limited resources and be resourceful. Constraints force creativity and better solutions. Be curious and don’t be afraid to question the status quo.
        <br><br>We believe actions speak louder than words. 
        Every encounter with our people and products should be memorable and helpful. Challenges are exciting, failure is how we learn, and we all have an entrepreneurial spirit. Building an inclusive and equitable workplace isn’t lip service. We invest our time and our money in organizations that are not only working to diversify the current jobscape, but also investing in the future of talent. We’re motivated by a strong, innovative, and passionate work culture and we’re constantly searching for ways to improve and get shift done.
        
        
        <h3>My Experience</h3><br>
        <p>
        It was a great experience in making this perticular web application.I
        enjoyed a lot making this and it was a bit challenging for me as time
        was very less.
        I have used simple Html, css and javascript to make this web
        application.I have useed Firebase. Bythis perticular application one can
        verify the candidates applied are eligible or not, it helps to schedule
        a date for interview and asks for the platform one is comfortable with,
        other than that the application tracks the dates which are assigned for
        interview, its shows a count down for how much time is left for
        Interview.
